My Marvel API Website


This Open API Project uses Marvel's open source APi to provide a "Hero Search" Experience.
On the home page, the user is directed to a navigation button that once clicked, the webpage displays an array of 20 random Marvel Heroes.
Further instructions tell the user to click on a hero of their choice, which then caauses the webpage to display an array of comics that the selected hero is a part of. If the hero has no comics associated with its hero id then a message telling same will be displayed.
The user can use the home button to return to the homepage and restart the Hero Search Experience.
